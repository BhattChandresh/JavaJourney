# ObjectOutStream converts the Java Object to BInary data.
# FileOutStream convert the Binary data of Java object to File.
# Same is true for ObjectInputStream and FileInputStream.
# We need to implement 'Serializable' interface for the class which we want to serialization.
# We can serialize and deserialize any number of object but the order in which we serialize then
     in the same order we need to deserialize the objects.
# transient is a modifier which is applied to variable only.
# static variable is not taking part in serialization.
# transient variable will take part in serialization but because it is constant direct value will be stored in file.
# 'Serializable' interface present in java.io.* package.
# When we serialize the object then set of all objects which are reachable from that object will be serialized automatically. This group of object is nothing but the Object Graph.
